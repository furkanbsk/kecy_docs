What Do I Need for This Module?

The equipment is listed below - here you will assemble your robot laboratory.

This module is about **constructing and standardizing the real-world task area**. This includes a lightbox enclosure, lighting, cameras, mat, vials, and rack—so it matches the Isaac Lab scene used for training and evaluation.

Building the lightbox this way gives you a consistent environment, so you can use our models and datasets.

You can also keep using it after this learning path, to do more of your own robot experiments!

Why are we starting with the physical workspace?

When you do Physical AI work in the real world, you might not have a **physical** workspace available to you when you start out. We often start in sim, for all the reasons we discussed earlier (ease of testing, cost, safety, ease of iteration).

For this workshop, we will set up the physical space first for three reasons:

1.  We give you this info early on, so you can order parts or build your workspace in prep for finishing the learning path

2.  To give you experience with the physical robot and teleoperation. It's fun!

3.  To give you a sense of how "hard" the task is, when using the same inputs the AI model will have (two cameras, joint positions)

:::

## The Lightbox Environment

Let's start by building a **white lightbox enclosure** that includes:

1.  **Cameras** — one on the robot (wrist / gripper view), one stationary (external / scene view)

2.  **Lights** — diffuse light with controllable brightness

3.  **Props** — centrifuge vials, yellow rack, foam mat.

![Vial Rack](/img/sim-to-real/05-calisma-alani/vial_rack.jpg)

Why we use a lightbox

**Limits variables for learning and debugging** A plain, bright enclosure reduces visual noise so the policy can focus on the task-relevant features—gripper, vials, and rack.

**Matches the digital twin** The Isaac Lab scene replicates this enclosure's dimensions, color, camera placements, and object geometry. Matching the real bench to that design shrinks the visual domain gap—one of the main sources of sim-to-real failure.

**Accommodates low-performance cameras** Consumer webcams have auto-exposure and limited dynamic range. Bright, diffuse lighting inside the box keeps images clean and consistent.

**Enables transferable models** Controlling the environment makes it easier to prepare models that transfer across robots and setups. Debugging focuses on policy and calibration, not uncontrolled scene drift.

## Bill of Materials

The complete robot + workspace setup should cost less than $500 USD, estimated based on the options below.

We recommend getting the SO-101 pre-assembled, as it comes with a teleop arm and is easier to assemble. You can also build it yourself, but it's a bit more work.

## Build the Workspace

In short, we'll:

1.  **Cut** the foam board to size

2.  **Cut** a hole for the external camera

3.  **Mount** the light

4.  **Clamp** and **position** the props and robot.

### Assemble the Lightbox

1.  **Cut** 2 of the 5 foam board panels down to 20" x 20". These will become the sides.

2.  On one of the 20"x20" panels, **cut** a rectangular hole for the external camera. The Logitech webcam arm is approximately 5 cm × 1.5 cm — size the hole to slide it through snugly.

3.  Now **assemble** the box - there are two options:

Option A — Tape (fast)

White duct tape or gaffer tape along the seams.

- **Pros**: cheap, fast, no tools required

- **Cons**: removing the tape later will damage the foam board

Keep foam board edges flush when taping. Running tape along the full length of each seam produces the strongest bond; small pieces work but are weaker.

Option B — 3D-printed corners (reusable)

Print the corner assemblies from the BOM link above and snap panels in.

- **Pros**: clean look, easy to disassemble and reassemble

- **Cons**: requires access to a 3D printer

### Camera Placement Measurements

| Parameter

|

Value

|  |
|  |

|

**Height**

|

40 cm from base of lightbox

| |

**Distance from back wall**

|

~27 cm from back of robot to center of camera lens

| |

**Lateral offset from back**

|

24 cm from back panel

| |

**Angle**

|

45 deg downward, aimed at the workspace. Make sure the camera has a good view of both the robot, the vials, and the rack.

|

:::tip

Verify the camera view matches the sample images before finalizing the slot position. A few centimeters of error is acceptable; large deviations change what the policy sees and degrade performance.

:::

## Set Up the Light

The light should be **bright, diffuse, and daylight-temperature**. If you use the lights listed in the BOM, they are already diffuse.

:::warning

These lights can get warm over extended use. Do not leave them on overnight, and monitor temperature during long sessions.

:::

Foam board top — interior mount

If you use foam board for the top panel, mount a diffuse panel light inside the lightbox facing down. Zip ties through small holes in the foam board are the most reliable attachment; tape can work but may release from heat.

Open top — external mount

Clamp or position an external diffuse light above the open top, angled to illuminate the workspace evenly.

[![Turning on and adjusting lightbox lighting](/img/sim-to-real/05-calisma-alani/light-operation.gif)](/img/sim-to-real/05-calisma-alani/light-operation.gif)

_Turn on the light and set brightness before teleoperation or policy runs._

1.  **Press** the **power button** on the light.

2.  **Press and hold** the **power button** again until the travel lock progress bar completes and the light stays on.

3.  **Use** the **brightness controls**; for evaluations and data collection, target roughly **50-100 %**.

4.  **Plug in** the light if AC power is available; battery-only runs may not last a full session.

## Mount the Robot

Clamp the SO-101 to a solid table. Position it so the base sits inside the lightbox at the position shown in the reference photo below.

This gives it good range-of-motion and lets the external camera see the robot well.

**Verify** the clamps do **not** restrict the robot's range of motion—test by manually moving each joint through its range before powering on.

![Lightbox](/img/sim-to-real/05-calisma-alani/so101_workspace.jpg)

## Arrange the Mat, Vials, and Rack

Our simulation environment and checkpoint models are overfit to the rack generally being on the **left** side and vials on the **right**. Use the reference photo above for positioning.

If you customize the Isaac Lab environment we'll use later, you could try out other configurations!

### Rack Placement Measurements

Place the foam mat flat under the vials, and scatter 1-3 vials on the mat in varied poses (same general layout as in simulation).

## Physical Layout Checklist

Before you place the robot in the enclosure or run any real-robot software:

1.  **Enclosure** — Lightbox panels assembled; interior clear of stray objects.

2.  **Mat and props** — Foam mat flat; **yellow rack** in its designated spot; **1-3 vials** on the mat in varied poses (same general layout as in simulation).

3.  **Cameras** — Wrist and external cameras mounted and aimed so both the mat/rack and gripper workspace are visible; no heavy occlusion or glare.

4.  **Cables** — Route camera and robot cables so they do **not** snag or limit joint motion (cables can create false calibration limits; see [Troubleshooting](/sim-to-real/referans/sorun-giderme), _Calibration Fails_).

5.  **Lighting** — Light on and bright enough (previous section).

Re-check this checklist **before** [Real Evaluation](/sim-to-real/veri-egitim-degerlendirme/gercek-degerlendirme) and before each [Strategy 2](/sim-to-real/veri-zenginlestirme/strateji-2-cotraining) / [Strategy 3](/sim-to-real/veri-zenginlestirme/strateji-3-cosmos) deployment if anything was moved.

## Key Takeaways

- Workspace setup is critical for successful training and deployment.
